For my final project i have created a bank application where customers can have access to:
* Transfer their money
* Buy Airtime (as we do here in my country (Nigeria), and also
* Pay bills


Staff are selected at random when a new customer is registered and they are attached to customers as their account manager, so a staff might have more than one customers.

A staff or an account manager have access to:
* view all the transactions made by their customers,
* Call customer for any Emergency,
* Send mail to customer,
* View customer expenditures under some specified category


Another main feature of this web application is that from the Expenditure Category: 
* Properties,
* Food,
* Investement,
* shelter and
* Mecsellaneous


and  Naration that the customer will provide while making transactions most expecially when transferring money (Buying airtime and paying bills will be automatically generated) will be use to analyse the customer's account which show how many percentage of total income spent on each category that is it can show the customer that he/she has spent 40% of his/her income on Investement and 30% on Food for example.


My project has satisfied all the requirements:
* My project is sufficiently distinct form other projects,
* I've utilize Django (with more than one model) as my backend and Javascript as my Frontend and
* It's mobile responsive


For testing, While registering the via the admin page use the username field for email but i've created a staff and some customer already:
### Staff:
    Email: staff@3nitybank.com
    password: MANAGER12345

### Customers:
    Email: paulinnocent@email.com
    password: 12345,

    Email: lilian@email.com
    password: 12345
